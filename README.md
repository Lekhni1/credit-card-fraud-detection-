## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Google Colab**: Environment used for development and testing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available credit card fraud detection dataset. It contains anonymized features of credit card transactions, with the `Class` column indicating whether a transaction was fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding data patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Using machine learning algorithms to classify transactions (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Model Testing**: Testing the model on unseen data and making predictions.
